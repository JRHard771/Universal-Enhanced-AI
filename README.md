# Universal Enhanced AI
Universal Enhanced AI is a general-purpose AI enhancement mutator for GZDoom that features broad compatibility with various games and mods. It enhances monster AI with the ability to remember the last position and heading of their target and the ability to share this information with other nearby monsters.

Planned features include optional light-based stealth, making it more difficult for monsters to see targets in dark sectors.
